Terms
The products and services are provided by Pokadot, Inc. (“OpenMic”, “us”, “we” or “our”). Please carefully read these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy and our DMCA Copyright Policy (collectively, the “Terms of Service”). The Terms of Service govern your access to and use of OpenMic’s services, including OpenMic’s websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, ads and other services (collectively, the “Services”).

The 'What It Means' comments below in bold and purple are intended to clarify and explain these terms. They are not legally binding.

4. Content
Definition
For purposes of these Terms of Service, the term “Content” includes, any information, audio, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services. “Content” also includes all User Content (as defined below).

User Content
All Content added, created, uploaded, submitted, distributed, or posted to the Services by users (collectively “User Content”), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person who originated such User Content. You represent that all User Content provided by you is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, but not limited to, copyright laws. You acknowledge that all Content, including User Content, accessed by you using the Services is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to you or any other party resulting therefrom. We do not pre-screen content and do not guarantee that any Content you access on or through the Services is or will continue to be accurate.

What it means:

You're not allowed to use OpenMic to infringe on copyrighted content, break any laws, or cause harm to other people. If you do, you'll be held personally and solely responsible.

Notices and Restrictions
The Services may contain Content specifically provided by us, our partners or our users. Such Content is protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized by us, you agree not to modify, copy, frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on such Content, in whole or in part, except that the foregoing does not apply to your own User Content that you legally upload to the Services. You will abide by and maintain all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services.

What it means:

Please don't attempt to alter, interfere with, scrape, or sell content that is not your own.

Use License
Subject to these Terms of Service, we grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use, copy, distribute and display Content solely for purposes of using the Services. You will not sell, license, rent, or otherwise use any Content for commercial use or in any way that violates any third party right.

What it means:

Content on OpenMic can be consumed, distributed, and shared by other OpenMic users. However, users cannot sell each other's content without the content owner's permission.

License Grant
You retain all of your ownership rights in your User Content. Using OpenMic never has and never will cause you to lose ownership of your content.

What it means:

You own your content. By using OpenMic, you are not giving up any rights to use your content in any way or any place you want. OpenMic prides itself on empowering creators, and we have no intention to limit your rights in your content in any way.

By submitting User Content through the Services, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive license to use, edit, modify, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, display, and perform the User Content in connection with the operation of the Services, the promotion, advertising or marketing of the Services, and the operation of OpenMic’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business. This license is worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable.

What it means:

In order to use OpenMic, you are giving us permission to use, host, and distribute the content you create. For instance, this license allow us to syndicate your content to other platforms, so that your audience can hear your podcast anywhere they choose. We believe strongly in creators’ rights, and in no way does this license take away the ownership rights you have in your content.

You agree that this license includes, without limitation, the right for OpenMic to provide, promote, and improve the Services. We may also use this license to make User Content available to other companies, organizations or individuals who partner with OpenMic for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of such User Content on other media and services.

What it means:

One of the best parts of OpenMic is the ability to create in one place and optionally let us handle the hassle of distributing your podcast everywhere. This language allows us to distribute your content on your behalf, so that you can focus on creating and leave the technical headache of podcast distribution to us. You are also welcome to distribute your podcast to other platforms manually if you prefer.

Such license will terminate within a commercially reasonable time upon the termination of your account on OpenMic as it applies to User Content stored in the Services or otherwise controlled by OpenMic at the time of termination.

What it means:

If you leave OpenMic (which you are free to do at any time) and ask us to delete your content, we will do so promptly. Note that content that is distributed to third parties may be out of our control. In those cases, you may have to reach out to other companies (such as audio playing apps) to ask them to remove your content directly.

You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other information about the Services (“Submissions”), provided by you to us are non-confidential and we will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these Submissions for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you.

What it means:

We love when our users give feedback or propose ideas. We encourage you to do so! We just ask that you be aware that while we may follow through on your proposals, we unfortunately can't pay you for them.

For clarity, these license grants do not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Content, including the right to grant additional licenses to your User Content, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You represent and warrant that you have all rights to grant such licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third party rights, including without limitation, any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.

What it means:

YOU own your own content. However, you also promise us that your content is actually yours, and that by putting it on OpenMic, you're not violating anyone else's rights.

Availability of Content
We do not guarantee that any Content will be made available through the Services. You acknowledge that we may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Services, including without limitation the maximum period of time that Content will be retained by the Services and the maximum storage space that will be allotted on our servers on your behalf. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content maintained or uploaded by the Services. We reserve the right to, but do not have any obligation to, (i) remove any Content in our sole discretion, at any time, without notice to you and for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we are concerned that you may have violated these Terms of Service), or for no reason at all and (ii) to remove or block any Content from the Services.

What it means:

We have the right to remove content from our platform for various reasons, including what we believe are violations of these terms. We encourage you to back up all of your audio, just in case.

What it means:

You agree not to use OpenMic's brand, including our logo, for any purpose without our permission. Doing so may be an infringement of our intellectual property.

All goodwill generated from the use of OpenMic Trademarks will inure to our exclusive benefit.

When you access third party resources on the Internet, you do so at your own risk. These other resources are not under our control, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply our endorsement or any association between us and their operators.

What it means:

You further acknowledge and agree that we will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such website or resource.

You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application; Apple is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law.

In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple's sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Application, or any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty, which will be our sole responsibility, to the extent it cannot be disclaimed under applicable law; You acknowledge and agree that OpenMic, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, OpenMic, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim; You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a 'terrorist supporting' country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties; Both you and OpenMic acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and Both you and OpenMic acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms of Service, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms of Service, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Service against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.

10. Social Networking Services
You may enable or log in to the Services via various online third party services, such as social media and social networking services like Facebook or Twitter (the “Social Networking Services”). By logging in or directly integrating these Social Networking Services into the Service, we make your online experiences richer and more personalized. To take advantage of this feature and capabilities, we may ask you to authenticate, register for or log into Social Networking Services on the websites of their respective providers. As part of such integration, the Social Networking Services will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such Social Networking Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

What it means:

If you choose to link your other social accounts to OpenMic through some of our features, you recognize that some data about you is shared between us and these third parties.

However, please remember that the manner in which Social Networking Services use, store and disclose your information is governed solely by the policies of such third parties, and we will have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any third party site or service that may be enabled on the Services.

As such, we are not liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such Social Networking Services. We enable these features merely as a convenience and the integration or inclusion of such features does not imply an endorsement or recommendation.

11. Termination
We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership.

What it means:

Common sense and generally being a nice person means you can use OpenMic all you wish! But if we do ever find reason to terminate your account, we have the ability to do so without a guarantee that we will notify you.

You agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Services.

If you wish to terminate your Account, you may do so by contacting us at help@OpenMic.fm.

All provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, licenses of User Content not otherwise terminated in the manner described above, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

12. Warranty Disclaimer
We have no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to you.

You acknowledge that we have no duty to take any action regarding: which users gain access to the Services; what Content you access via the Services; or how you may interpret or use the Content.

You release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We make no representations concerning any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, or legality of material or Content contained in or accessed through the Services.

The Services and Content are provided “as is”, “as available” and without warranty of any kind, express, statutory or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties implied by any course of performance or usage of trade, all of which are expressly disclaimed. We, and our directors, employees, agents, suppliers, partners and content providers do not warrant that: (I) the Services will be secure or available at any particular time or location; (II) any defects or errors will be corrected; (III) any content or software available through the Services is free of viruses or other harmful components; or (IV) the results of using the Services will meet your requirements. Your use of the services is solely at your own risk. The foregoing disclaimers of warranties in this section of the Terms are not enforceable with respect to users of the Service from New Jersey, to the extent that such disclaimer is unreasonable.

What it means:

We do our best to build the best darn podcasting platform in the world. But we can't make any guarantees. You agree we won't be liable if it ever doesn't work as intended, or if you come across content or users that you're not happy with.

13. Indemnification
You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and each of our and their respective employees, contractors, directors, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the Services, Content, or otherwise from your User Content, violation of these Terms of Service or any other terms and conditions provided by use to you that are applicable to your use of specific Services (such as the Monetization Terms of Service), or infringement by you, or any third party using your Account or identity in the Services, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.

We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses. Any obligation to indemnify any indemnified party for any loss, liability or expense arising from any negligent, grossly negligent, reckless, willful, fraudulent or intentional conduct committed by any indemnified party is not enforceable against any user of the service from New Jersey.

What it means:

If we ever get sued and it's because you violated these terms, some rule, or a law, or created content that caused someone else to sue us, you agree to reimburse us for the consequences of your misdeeds or that content.

14. Limitation of Liability
In no event will we, nor our directors, employees, agents, partners, suppliers or content providers, be liable under contract, tort, strict liability, negligence or any other legal or equitable theory with respect to the services (I) for any lost profits, data loss, use or inability to use the services, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data, statements or conduct of any third party on the services, or special, indirect, incidental, punitive, compensatory or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever (however arising), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages, (II) for any bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, or the like (regardless of the source of origination), or (III) for any direct damages in excess of (in the aggregate) the greater of (A) ees paid to us for the particular Services during the immediately previous three (3) month period or (B) $500.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations set forth above may not apply to you. If you are dissatisfied with any portion of these services of with these Terms of Service, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of the services.

What it means:

We have no intention of this ever happening. But, if we ever do something that somehow causes you to suffer a financial loss, you agree to a limit to how much we may need to reimburse you.

Any limitation of our liability with respect to liability arising from our negligence, gross negligence or intentional misconduct is not enforceable with respect to users of the Service from New Jersey.

15. Arbitration
We strongly encourage you to review this Arbitration Clause and Class Action Waiver, as it affects your legal rights.

What it means:

If you and OpenMic ever have a disagreement (and we hope that never happens!), instead of facing the lengthy and expensive process of going to court, we agree to use the alternative dispute resolution process described here.

Arbitration
You agree that all disputes between you and us (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with us, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Service, your user of the Services, and/or your rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s Rules for Arbitration under the American Arbitration Association’s Rules for Arbitration of Consumer-Related Disputes and you and we hereby expressly waive trial by juryand judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration proceedings will be conducted before one (1) neutral arbitrator selected by the American Arbitration Association. The place of arbitration will be New York, New York. Either party may apply to the arbitrator seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under these Terms of service, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the ARBITRATOR (or pending the ARBITRATOR’S determination of the merits of the controversy). As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. You are giving up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against us including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.

Severability
If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.

16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms of Service or otherwise not subject to arbitration will be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of San Francisco, California.

What it means:

We're based in SF, so that's the law that governs this agreement.

17. Miscellaneous
Entire Agreement and Severability
These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder

What it means:

These are our terms, our whole terms, and nothing but our terms.

Force Majeure
We will not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.

What it means:

You agree not to hold us responsible if we can't fulfill part of this agreement because of events that are totally out of our control, like government intervention or an alien invasion.

Assignment
These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.

What it means:
